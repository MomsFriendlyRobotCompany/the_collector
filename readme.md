**This is still under heavy development**

The idea behind this a container that can store data and time tag the
data when it is captured. The main structure is a dict which has keys
for each data series stored.

This was written for a class I taught on robotics. It is meant to be simple and
teach the students some things. There are probably better solutions out there,
but I like this.

Additionally, there is nothing magically about what this does:

- It provides a generic interface to using `pickle` or `json` as
the protocol for saving data to disk
- It also allows you to convert between them if needed
- Bag files can be read using the original protocol, thus data is never lost
if this library goes away
- Designed to be simple and straight forward

## Setup

### Install

The suggested way to install this is via the `pip` command as follows:

    pip install the_collector
    pip install the_collector[numpy]

If you install `numpy`, then you get access to working with numpy arrays
using the functions: `array_pack()` and `array_pack()`. These really don't
save you much.

# Usage

## BagIt

Bag stores data in memory until the buffer size limit is reached then it dumps
the data to a file.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from the_collector import BagIt
from the_collector import Json, Pickle
import json


d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

bag = BagIt(Json)      # ascii, cross platform
# bag = BagIt(Pickle)  # binary, python only but handles python objects well

for i in range(10):
    bag.push('test', d) # push value d to key 'test'
    bag.push('bob', d)
    bag.push('tom', ('a', i,))

# timestamp adds a timestamp automatically to the bag file. Thus, you won't
# over write bob.json.bag each time you run this program because the filename
# is bob-2019-04-20-15:35:25.6543.json.bag
fname = bag.write('bob', timestamp=False)

print(">> created:", fname)

data = bag.read(fname) # data is just a dictionary
print(data)
```

Now, since there is nothing super special `the_collector` does with packing
data, you can always read the bag files using the original libraries:

```python
with open(fname, 'rb') as fd:
    data = json.load(fd)

for key, val in data.items():
    print("{}[{}]".format(key, len(val)))
    for v in val:
        print("{}".format(v), end=' ')
        print(' ')
```

## Data Tuple

Use a generic `namedtuple` for data storage. It will automatically insert a
timestamp when created. This is useful for tagging data with a timestamp and
not having to remember to do it yourself.

**WARNING:** `json` and `msgpack` have issues with `tuples`, so this is best
used with `pickle` or you have to accept `json` will turn it into a list and
`msgpack` will turn it into a regular `tuple`. Either way, you still keep the
timestamp.

```python
from the_collector import Data

d = Data((1,2,3,))  # timestamp generate when made

print("Data[{}]: {}".format(d.timestamp, d.data))
print("Namedtuple output:", d)
```
